# Nuno GÃ³is Portfolio (NuxtJS) - 2018

You can check it out here: https://www.nunogois.com

I've decided to make my website NuxtJS project open-source.

It is now a bit stale so expect revamp or a totally new website soon.

It is hosted on Vercel as a static (SSG) website (with `nuxt generate`) so that's why it is super fast!


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn # Or npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev # Or npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build # Or npm run build

# generate static project
$ yarn generate # Or npm run generate

# check-in / publish
$ git push origin master # Or through VSCode, etc - It will auto publish
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
