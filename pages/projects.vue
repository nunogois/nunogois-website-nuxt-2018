I've been working on the platform since 2011: From ASP.NET, SQL and Web API to .NET WinForms or Java, from Windows Services to Office Add-Ins. My favourite part of the platform is its flexibility - features like an intuitive Form Designer and a custom JavaScript framework mean that it is able to do pretty much anything you set your mind to."

It uses Nuxt.js (powered by Vue.js) as a generator of static files, replacing Bootstrap with the lighter Bulma, instead of jQuery it uses Vue.js and native JavaScript, providing a blazing fast SPA experience for its front-end. For the back-end, I've used Express (Node.js) to build an extremely simple API. I think its design is a step-up from the previous version and I was able to fit in a bit more content in an organized way."
