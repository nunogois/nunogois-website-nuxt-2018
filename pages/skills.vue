Yes, it has its weird parts, but you can do pretty much everything you think of with it and a bit of front-end knowledge (HTML, CSS). I use JSON even for non-JavaScript related projects. I've started using JavaScript mostly with jQuery as a DOM manipulator and AJAX, but now I'm using it with Node.js with Express, Nuxt/Vue.js, Socket.io, NativeScript, some experiments on Electron and just plain JavaScript using some new ECMAScript cool features sometimes. TypeScript seems great from what I've seen and I intend to dive deeper into it at a later stage."
